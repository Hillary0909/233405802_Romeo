      <p>Aristotle was born in 384 BCE in Stagira, a town in northern Greece. He was the son of Nicomachus, the court physician to the Macedonian royal family. His early education and exposure to the medical sciences influenced his later philosophical inquiries.</p>
      <p>At the age of 17, Aristotle moved to Athens to study at Plato's Academy, where he remained for twenty years, becoming one of Plato's most notable students.</p>
      <p>During his time in Athens, Aristotle began to explore various subjects, developing interests that extended beyond the philosophical teachings of Plato.</p>

      <p>Aristotle’s philosophy is characterized by his method of logical inquiry, often referred to as the Aristotelian method. He emphasized the importance of observation and categorization in understanding the natural world.</p>
      <p>Aristotle developed a unique approach to metaphysics, arguing for the existence of a "Prime Mover" as the initial cause of all motion and change in the universe.</p>
      <p>His logical framework is organized into syllogistic reasoning, a method used to form conclusions based on premises. Aristotle is considered the founder of formal logic.</p>
      <p>Aristotle’s works, like "Metaphysics" and "Categories," laid the foundations for many areas in Western philosophy and scientific inquiry.</p>
      <code>Example of Aristotelian logic:</code>
      <ul>
        <li>If all humans are mortal, and Aristotle is a human, then Aristotle is mortal.</li>
        <li>This reasoning approach set the standard for logical frameworks in Western thought.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="Scientific_Contributions" class="main-section">
      <header>Scientific Contributions</header>
      <p>Aristotle made significant contributions to biology, especially in the areas of zoology and natural history. He classified animals based on their characteristics and organized them into groups.</p>
      <p>His observations and notes on animal behavior, anatomy, and reproduction formed some of the earliest biological classifications in Western history.</p>
      <p>In physics, Aristotle developed a geocentric model of the universe and theorized about the nature of matter, although his theories were later replaced by scientific advancements.</p>
      <code>Example of Aristotle's classification system:</code>
      <ul>
        <li>Mammals</li>
        <li>Birds</li>
        <li>Reptiles</li>
        <li>Fish</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="Ethics_and_Politics" class="main-section">
      <header>Ethics and Politics</header>
      <p>Aristotle’s ethical theory, known as "Nicomachean Ethics," emphasizes the pursuit of virtue as a means to achieve happiness. He identified virtues as a balance between extremes, such as courage being the balance between recklessness and cowardice.</p>
      <p>Aristotle’s political philosophy, outlined in "Politics," explores the nature of communities and the ideal state. He believed that humans are "political animals" who thrive best within a structured society.</p>
      <code>Virtue: Courage = Balance between cowardice and recklessness</code>
      <ul>
        <li>Justice</li>
        <li>Prudence</li>
        <li>Temperance</li>
        <li>Friendship</li>
      </ul>

      <header>Legacy and Influence</header>
      <p>Aristotle's contributions influenced Western philosophy, science, and education for centuries. His works laid the groundwork for natural sciences, ethics, and political theory, shaping the intellectual landscape of the Western world.</p>
      <p>Aristotle’s writings were preserved by Islamic scholars and reintroduced to Europe in the Middle Ages, sparking a resurgence in Aristotelian thought during the Renaissance.</p>
      <p>Today, Aristotle is regarded as one of the most influential thinkers in history, with his ideas remaining relevant in contemporary philosophy and science.</p>
