      <p>Hey, I know that you can't read this but even if you don't know, you know how much i'd love you. This is my message to you Bin Laden, I know your name is kind of ridiculous and my mom named you that. If you were a person you will hate your name cause that name is controversial
      and terrorist. But it's okay it doesn't matter anyway.</p>

      <p id="cat">"Thank you for being my constant companion, my gentle friend, and my source of comfort. Through every high and low, you have been there, curling up beside me, offering your warmth and presence. Your quiet purrs and playful spirit fill my days with so much joy, making even the hardest moments easier just by being close.

        Youâ€™ve taught me about loyalty and love in the simplest, purest way. I am so grateful for every memory we share and for the peace you bring into my life. Thank you, my sweet friend, for being my family. I am forever blessed to have you by my side."</p>
